# CS867: Computer Vision

This repository contains the released assignments for the Fall 2019 offering of CS 867 Computer Vision Elective Course. 

The assignments cover a wide range of topics in computer vision and should expose students to a broad range of concepts and applications. Thaere is rich set of image processing and machine learning libraries available in Python. During this and following cources the students will be trainined to use them with the help of assignments. 

A comprehensive list of Python libraries and packages used for computer vision can be seen [here](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/python-image-manipulation-tools). 

Saveral electronic books are provided in a google drive, the link is shared on LMS. These books can be an excellent resource for the beginers as well as for the experts. 

Assignment 1 starts off with an introduction on how to use images in python and numpy. It focuses on understanding and implemting the basic concepts such as image manipulation operation using matrices, convolutions, different kernels and how to design them and edge detection e.t.c. A couple of extra credit questions are also there.
